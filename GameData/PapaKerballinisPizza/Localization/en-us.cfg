	// PapaKerballinisPizza experiment
		#PIZZA-default = You open the box and observe the pizza.
		#PIZZA-BopInSpace = The box begins to resonate, causing an odd harmonic effect inside the vessel. It's very unsettling.
		#PIZZA-BopSrfLanded = The pizza is very brown and lumpy. You poke at it with your glove and notice how hard it is.
		#PIZZA-DresSrfLanded = When you look closely at the pizza, you can see there are many different types of toppings baked together.
		#PIZZA-DunaInSpace = The pizza takes on a red sheen. It looks very much like the planet below.
		#PIZZA-DunaSrfLanded = After much testing, you determine that red sand castles might be a good place to observe the pizza.
		#PIZZA-DunaSrfLanded = Everywhere you look, you see red.
		#PIZZA-EeLooInSpace = For a moment the instruments suddenly read off the charts! The box flexes outwards and then settles.
		#PIZZA-EeLooInSpace = While observing the pizza, you feel as though something is looking back at you from the shadows of the box.
		#PIZZA-EelooSrfLanded = You lay down and give the pizza box a hug, just so it knows it's not alone out here.
		#PIZZA-EveInSpace = The pizza has become rubbery and bounces around the box.
		#PIZZA-EveInSpace = The pizza takes on a purple coloration. Is it just the lighting, or did it change color?
		#PIZZA-EveSrfLanded = Did you eat too many slices before you left? You feel so sluggish and heavy...
		#PIZZA-EveSrfLanded = The pizza is tinted purple. You feel like you're changing color. Is there something growing on the pizza?
		#PIZZA-GillySrfLanded = You can barely move without flying away from the surface. You wish you had brought an anchor.
		#PIZZA-IkeSrfLanded = There's a bunch of large rocks scattered around the surface, might be nice place to take a selfie with the pizza!
		#PIZZA-IkeSrfLanded = You look up at the sky and see something zip past... Was that the mythical parmesan cheese?
		#PIZZA-InSpace = The pizza floats right at home here.
		#PIZZA-JoolSrfLanded = You're not sure how you even resisted the call of the pizza for so long. But it's probably best not to think about it for too long.
		#PIZZA-KerbinFlyingHigh = The pizza seems to be getting very cold now.
		#PIZZA-KerbinFlyingLow = The pizza slides around in its box.
		#PIZZA-KerbinInSpaceLow = The pizza nonchalantly floats out of its box, thankfully it is cold else the toppings would be a mess in the consoles! It also appears to have become stale.
		#PIZZA-KerbinSrf = I don't think a spacesuit was entirely necessary to get here, and the spacesuit makes it nearly impossible to smell the pizza!
		#PIZZA-KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The pizza seems to smell even better here, as the cheese oozes in such a *drool* way.
		#PIZZA-KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The pizza seems bored. Best to make sure it is still good and have a slice!
		#PIZZA-KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The pizza doesn't seem to be doing much right now, but it smells great.
		#PIZZA-KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The pizza seems to behave very much the same as it always does around here, best to keep the whole pie to yourself.
		#PIZZA-KerbinSrfLandedShores = The pizza, wait one minute, gosh dagnabit! there seems to be missing a piece and your crewmate has what only can be described as pizza sauce on their mouth!
		#PIZZA-KerbinSrfSplashedShores = The pizza wobbles around in its now soggy box and starts to become unappetizingly soggy.
		#PIZZA-KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The pizza slowly goes mushy, but the cheese seems to float!
		#PIZZA-LaytheSrfLanded = Suddenly the long forgotten smell of pizza wafts into your nostrils. You uncontrollably scarf down the pizza. You write a note on your report: 'the box seems okay'.
		#PIZZA-LaytheSrfLanded = This place seems nice and comfortable. So comfortable you feel like taking your helmet off. You check the box on your report for -edible yet frozen-.
		#PIZZA-MinmusSrfLanded = You feel like having some mint ice cream with your pizza
		#PIZZA-MohoInSpace = The pizza seems to be almost frozen. It slides around its box like an Minimus bowling ball.
		#PIZZA-MohoSrfLanded = The pizza, it's getting re-baked!
		#PIZZA-Mun = The pizza seems to be less dense here.
		#PIZZA-MunSrfLanded = The dust makes the pizza look grey and inedible.
		#PIZZA-MunSrfLanded = You look up and search the sky for Kerbin. Suddenly you realize that it doesn't look like a big pizza pie in the sky...
		#PIZZA-PolInSpace = Gooey tentacles reach out of the box, freeze, and break off. Fascinating!
		#PIZZA-PolSrfLanded = Everywhere you look it appears the planet is sharp. Could Pol be a giant pizza cutter?
		#PIZZA-SunInSpaceHigh = You feel kind of small right now... You hope you know where you're going.
		#PIZZA-TyloSrfLanded = The gravity here is pretty comfortable and the pizza likes it, although you are certain that is it now one giant lump of frozen dough.
		#PIZZA-VallSrfLanded = The surface occasionally rumbles beneath you. This reminds you that you are hungry and there is a pizza stuck to the side of your craft.

	// evaPizzaScience experiment
		#PIZZA-eva-titl = Papa Kerballini's Experimental Pizza
		#PIZZA-eva-default = Watching the astronaut look at and open the pizza box has given us conclusive evidence that the new situation has not improved their hunger. In fact attaching a pizza box, even if it does contain a Papa Kerballini's Pizza, might not have been the greatest idea. Pepperoni and black olives seems to have smeared the hull. Maybe it is time to design a better pizza container.
