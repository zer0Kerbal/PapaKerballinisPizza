# PapaKerballinisPizza (PKP)

[Home](./index.md)

From the creator of, well this, comes a science mod aimed at adding stock alike science experiments. They are designed to be stock alike, and fit in right along with other mods. There is currently six parts, a pee Experiment, a science lab, a sonic emitter, a atmospheric scoop, a electrostatic analyzer, and a alpha magnetic spectrometer. Any and all feedback is appreciated, as this is my first ever mod. I have a Trello so you can see what I want to do with this mod. I know that textures aren't good by any means, but I am working on that and have some amazing concepts already. Have fun crashing!
